Hi, I’m Jurijs.

With almost 20 years in IT, I’ve worked on everything from VoIP and SIP to tackling broader tech challenges. This blog is where I share what I’ve learned along the way—whether it’s about Freeswitch, coding, or solving everyday IT puzzles.

I also built [certdecoder.com](https://certdecoder.com/), a free online tool for decoding X.509 certificates directly in your browser 🔍🔐

Right now, I’m building [banana.dog](https://banana.dog/) — a tools directory 🍌🐶

I also run [howmanyofme.one](https://howmanyofme.one/) — a quirky name-check tool, not to be taken too seriously 😅👀
