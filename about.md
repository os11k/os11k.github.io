Hi, I’m Jurijs.

With almost 20 years in IT, I’ve worked on everything from VoIP and SIP to tackling broader tech challenges. This blog is where I share what I’ve learned along the way—whether it’s about Freeswitch, coding, or solving everyday IT puzzles.

I also built [certdecoder.com](https://certdecoder.com/), a free online tool for decoding X.509 certificates directly in your browser.
