Hi, I'm Jurijs.

With almost 20 years in IT, I've worked on everything from VoIP and SIP to tackling broader tech challenges. This blog is where I share what I've learned along the way—whether it's about Freeswitch, coding, or solving everyday IT puzzles.

My articles have been featured in several mailing lists including [tldr.tech](https://tldr.tech/) DevOps newsletter (200k+ readers), [Terraform Weekly](https://www.terraformweekly.com/), and [mkdev.me](https://mkdev.me/).

Now I'm building [statusalert.io](https://statusalert.io/) — a simple monitoring tool for websites & servers 🔭🚨

I built [certdecoder.com](https://certdecoder.com/), a free online tool for decoding X.509 certificates directly in your browser 🔍🔐

I also built [banana.dog](https://banana.dog/) — a tools directory 🍌🐶

I also run [howmanyofme.one](https://howmanyofme.one/) — a quirky name-check tool, not to be taken too seriously 😅👀

And I created [randomobjectgenerator.one](https://randomobjectgenerator.one/) — a simple tool to generate random objects 🎲🧩
